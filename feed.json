I did too! When I went looking for a book that really explored the story behind these iconic instruments, I couldn’t find one that focused on what makes them so special. So, I (and ChatGPT) decided to dive in myself—not to write a complete history, but to shine a spotlight on 12 legendary basses that changed the game.</p><p>Here are the basses featured in the book:</p><ul><li>Fender Precision Bass (1951)</li><li>Höfner 500/1 Violin Bass (1956)</li><li>Fender Precision Bass Redesign (1957)</li><li>The Fender Jazz Bass (1960)</li><li>Rickenbacker 4001 (1961)</li><li>Gibson Thunderbird (1963)</li><li>Alembic Series I (1971)</li><li>Music Man Stingray (1976)</li><li>The Steinberger L-2 (1980)</li><li>Warwick Thumb (1995)</li><li>Dingwall Combustion (2000)</li><li>Sadowsky Metro Series (2010)</li></ul><h3 id=\"exert-from-the-first-chapter\"><a href=\"#exert-from-the-first-chapter\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Exert from the first chapter:</a></h3><h4 id=\"the-origins-of-the-bass-guitar-a-journey-from-upright-to-electric\"><a href=\"#the-origins-of-the-bass-guitar-a-journey-from-upright-to-electric\" class=\"heading-anchor\">THE ORIGINS OF THE BASS GUITAR: A JOURNEY FROM UPRIGHT TO ELECTRIC</a></h4><p>The bass guitar as we know it today is a cornerstone of modern music, anchoring rhythm and harmony across genres. However, its journey begins long before its electric counterpart took center stage. To fully appreciate the evolution of the bass guitar, it’s essential to understand the role of its predecessor—the double bass—and the challenges musicians faced with this instrument in the context of its time</p><h4 id=\"the-double-bass-foundation-of-harmony-and-rhythm\"><a href=\"#the-double-bass-foundation-of-harmony-and-rhythm\" class=\"heading-anchor\">THE DOUBLE BASS: FOUNDATION OF HARMONY AND RHYTHM</a></h4><p>The double bass, also known as the upright bass or contrabass, emerged in the 16th century as the largest and lowest-pitched member of the violin family. By the 18th and 19th centuries, it had become an indispensable part of orchestras, chamber ensembles, and later, jazz bands. Its deep, resonant tones provided the harmonic foundation for ensembles, allowing other instruments to soar melodically above its steady grounding. In orchestras, it reinforced the lower strings and added weight to the harmonic structure, while in jazz, it became a rhythmic pulse, often plucked in a walking bass style to drive the music forward.<br>Despite its essential role, the double bass presented significant challenges. Its size made it cumbersome to transport, and its lack of amplification limited its effectiveness in larger, louder ensembles or outdoor performances. Players often struggled to be heard, especially as music evolved into louder and more dynamic styles in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These limitations sparked the search for a more portable, louder alternative that could fulfill the same foundational role.</p><h4 id=\"early-innovations-bridging-the-gap\"><a href=\"#early-innovations-bridging-the-gap\" class=\"heading-anchor\">EARLY INNOVATIONS: BRIDGING THE GAP</a></h4><p>One of the earliest attempts to address these challenges was the tubular bass, patented by August Heckel in 1912. Shaped like a tuba and designed to produce low frequencies with greater portability, it was an intriguing concept but ultimately impractical. Its awkward design and lack of widespread appeal meant it never gained traction.</p><p>Meanwhile, the double bass continued to evolve within its limitations. In the burgeoning jazz scene of the early 20th century, players like Jimmy Blanton revolutionized its role, bringing melodic fluency and rhythmic complexity to the instrument. These innovations showcased the double bass’s versatility but also highlighted the need for a more practical solution for bassists in increasingly amplified settings.</p><h4 id=\"the-birth-of-the-electric-bass\"><a href=\"#the-birth-of-the-electric-bass\" class=\"heading-anchor\">THE BIRTH OF THE ELECTRIC BASS</a></h4><p>The search for a portable and amplified bass solution gained momentum in the 1930s with Paul Tutmarc’s invention of the Audiovox Model 736. This solid-body electric bass was a bold departure from the upright bass, featuring a horizontal design similar to a guitar. It allowed players to stand or sit comfortably while playing and could be amplified to match the volume of other instruments. Despite its innovation, the Audiovox Model 736 was ahead of its time and failed to achieve widespread adoption.</p><p>It wasn’t until the early 1950s that Leo Fender’s Fender Precision Bass brought the concept to life in a way that resonated with musicians and the music industry. Fender’s design was revolutionary not just for its practicality but also for its impact on the sound and structure of modern music. The Precision Bass was lighter, easier to play, and, crucially, amplified, making it ideal for the louder, evolving soundscapes of post-war music. It quickly became the go-to instrument for bassists in genres ranging from rock and roll to funk, jazz, and beyond. We will expand on this in the next chapter, as the Precision Bass remains an iconic instrument that not only revolutionized bass playing but also set the standard for all modern bass guitar designs. Its influence can be seen in nearly every electric bass that followed, cementing its place as a timeless cornerstone of music history.</p><hr><p>👉 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0F9L7242X/ref=cm_sw_r_as_gl_apa_gl_i_DDXW62B0KBY5D4RTKH96?linkCode=ml1&amp;tag=richorama-21\" rel=\"noopener\">Buy <em>Shaping the Groove</em> on Amazon</a></p>",

For just £85, you get everything you need: a maple neck, Rengas body (already primed!), amaranth fretboard, all the hardware, electronics, and even strings. It’s light, comfy, and—best of all—fun to put together. The kit is super approachable, even for beginners, but if you want a flawless painted finish, you’ll need a bit of patience (and maybe some practice). The stock tuners and pickup are basic, but that’s part of the fun: you can upgrade as you go. If you’d rather skip the DIY adventure, Harley Benton’s factory-finished P-Style basses are only a little more expensive.</p><hr><h3 id=\"building-experience\"><a href=\"#building-experience\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Building Experience</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Everything in the box</strong>: You get a bolt-on maple neck with a double-action truss rod, amaranth fretboard, pre-wired P-style split-coil pickup, volume and tone pots, and all the chrome hardware.</li><li><strong>No soldering stress</strong>: The electronics are pre-wired, so you don’t need to touch a soldering iron.</li><li><strong>A little care goes a long way</strong>: Take your time with sanding, lining things up, and fitting the parts. It’s straightforward, but a careful approach pays off.</li><li><strong>Shaping the headstock</strong> and picking your own finish is fun. Many folks say it’s “very easy to build” and “enjoyable”—and you don’t need to be a pro to get a playable result.</li></ul><hr><h3 id=\"cost-and-value\"><a href=\"#cost-and-value\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Cost and Value</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Super affordable</strong>: At £85, this kit is cheaper than most entry-level basses you’ll find in stores.</li><li><strong>You get what you pay for</strong>: The basics are all here, but some parts (like tuners, strings, and the pickup) are ripe for upgrading if you want to take things further.</li></ul><hr><h3 id=\"finish-and-painting\"><a href=\"#finish-and-painting\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Finish and Painting</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Ready for paint</strong>: The body and neck come primed with pore filler, so you can get straight to painting.</li><li><strong>Wood grain character</strong>: The Rengas wood grain still peeks through, even after painting. Some people love the look, others might want a smoother finish.</li><li><strong>Patience is key</strong>: Spray painting takes a gentle touch—sand up to P320 grit, use thin coats, and don’t rush. Runs and rough spots are easy to get if you hurry.</li><li><strong>Other options</strong>: If spray cans aren’t your thing, you could try staining, using a lacquer gun, or even asking a pro to finish it for you.</li></ul><hr><h3 id=\"hardware-quality\"><a href=\"#hardware-quality\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Hardware Quality</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Basic but functional</strong>: The included die-cast tuners work, but they can slip under tension. One of mine even had to go back. If tuning stability bugs you, swapping in locking tuners is a great first mod.</li><li><strong>Chunky bridge</strong>: The bridge is solid and does the job. Not the first thing I’d upgrade.</li><li><strong>Bridge mounting caution</strong>: The pre-drilled bridge screw holes on my kit weren’t perfectly lined up, so I had to tweak things a bit to get the bridge sitting right. Double-check before you screw it down!</li><li><strong>Classic pickup</strong>: The split-coil P-Style pickup gives you that familiar Precision bass sound, but it’s a bit on the thin side. Upgrading to a beefier or active pickup is a popular move.</li><li><strong>Pickguard mounting caution</strong>: Watch out when screwing in the pickguard—one of my screws broke through where the control cavity was routed, chipping the body. The wood here is fragile, so don’t overtighten, and consider reinforcing the holes with a dab of wood glue or a toothpick.</li></ul><hr><h3 id=\"playability-and-feel\"><a href=\"#playability-and-feel\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Playability and Feel</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Nice and light</strong>: The finished bass weighs about 3.5 kg, so it’s easy on your shoulder for long jams.</li><li><strong>Comfortable neck</strong>: The Canadian maple neck (42 mm nut) and amaranth fretboard feel just like a classic P-bass. Frets are generally good, but a little fret dressing might help.</li><li><strong>String swap recommended</strong>: The stock strings (.045–.105) are nothing special—putting on a fresh set makes a big difference in tone and tuning.</li></ul><hr><h3 id=\"customization-and-options\"><a href=\"#customization-and-options\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Customization and Options</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Make it yours</strong>: The headstock is a blank canvas, and you can upgrade electronics, pickguards, and hardware whenever you like. It’s a project that can keep evolving.</li><li><strong>Learn as you go</strong>: Building and tweaking the kit is a great way to pick up skills in woodworking, finishing, setup, and electronics—perfect for any bassist who likes to tinker.</li></ul><hr><h3 id=\"conclusion\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Conclusion</a></h3><p>If you’re looking for a fun, budget-friendly way to build your own bass, the Harley Benton Bass Guitar Kit P-Style is hard to beat. It’s light, playable, and gives you plenty of room to experiment and upgrade. If you want a perfect finish and pro-level hardware right out of the box, the factory-finished version might be a better fit—but for hands-on types, this kit is a real treat.</p>",

At just <strong>£17.99</strong>, it promises impressive specs for the price — including a detachable silver-plated cable, a 10mm magnetic driver, and multiple eartip options.</p><p>We were intrigued. Unfortunately, when it comes to bass — the one thing that really matters for this site — the KBEAR Storm fails hard.</p><hr><h3 id=\"pros\"><a href=\"#pros\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Pros</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Good Build Quality</strong>: The plastic housings feel well-made and solid, especially at this price point.</li><li><strong>Comfortable Fit</strong>: Lightweight and ergonomically shaped; they stay put during long sessions without fatigue.</li><li><strong>Attractive Design</strong>: Available in several colours with a sleek, modern look.</li><li><strong>Decent Accessories</strong>: Comes with multiple eartips (6 pairs in 3 sizes), which helps with fit and isolation.</li><li><strong>Quiet Cable</strong>: The over-ear cable doesn’t transmit rubbing noise, and it’s removable, allowing for upgrades.</li></ul><hr><h3 id=\"cons\"><a href=\"#cons\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Cons</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Lack of Bass Response</strong>: The biggest issue.

The KBEAR Storm, despite manufacturer claims of “powerful and affecting bass,” simply does <strong>not deliver</strong>.</p><p>No matter the source — phone, DAC/amp, or EQ tweaks — the low end remained thin and lifeless. Boosting 60–100 Hz did very little. Even 500 Hz boosts to recover warmth didn’t add punch.

Ray4 Review – The Budget Stingray That Missed the Mark</strong></p><p>Let’s get one thing out of the way: I’ve <strong>always wanted a Stingray</strong>. That big, bold Music Man tone, the iconic look, and that unmistakable 3+1 headstock have been calling my name for years. So when I spotted the <strong>Sterling by Music Man S.U.B. Ray4</strong>, I figured this might finally scratch the itch—without emptying the wallet.</p><p><strong>S.U.B.</strong>, in case you didn’t know, stands for <strong>“Sports Utility Bass”</strong>—and this Indonesian-made model is the most affordable entry into the Stingray world. It’s got the vibe, the looks (mostly), and the layout. But unfortunately, it didn’t quite deliver in the ways that matter most.</p><hr><h3 id=\"first-impressions\"><a href=\"#first-impressions\" class=\"heading-anchor\">First Impressions</a></h3><p>Out of the box, the <strong>Vintage Cream finish</strong> was… not quite what I expected. Online it looked classy and understated, but in person it leaned a bit more <strong>pink</strong>—kind of a <strong>“skin tone”</strong> shade that didn’t feel as bold or confident as I hoped. That’s purely subjective, of course, but it did leave me a little underwhelmed at first glance.</p><p>That said, it still has the <strong>classic Stingray shape</strong>, the <strong>3+1 headstock</strong>, and a nice slim <strong>38mm nut width</strong> that makes it comfortable in the hand.</p><hr><h3 id=\"build-and-hardware\"><a href=\"#build-and-hardware\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Build &amp; Hardware</a></h3><p>Now, this is where things started to wobble—literally. While tuning up for the first time, <strong>two of the tuners slipped</strong> as I tightened them. That’s not something you want to experience on a brand-new bass, no matter the price.</p><p>The body is made of <strong>basswood</strong>, paired with a <strong>maple neck</strong> and a <strong>jatoba fretboard</strong>. It’s a familiar recipe for budget instruments, and overall the construction is okay. Nothing alarming—aside from the tuners—but nothing exceptional either.</p><hr><h3 id=\"tone-and-electronics\"><a href=\"#tone-and-electronics\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Tone &amp; Electronics</a></h3><p>The S.U.B. Ray4 comes equipped with a single <strong>H-1 ceramic humbucker</strong> and <strong>active 2-band EQ</strong>. On paper, that should give you plenty of tonal flexibility and the aggressive Stingray bite we all know and love.</p><p>In practice? It just felt a little <strong>flat</strong>. The tone lacked <strong>dynamics</strong>, and even with some EQ tweaking, I couldn’t quite dial in the kind of presence I was after. The <strong>active electronics</strong> gave it volume and brightness, but not much character. It felt like the essence of the Stingray was only half there—like a photocopy of a painting.</p><hr><h3 id=\"verdict-good-but-not-great\"><a href=\"#verdict-good-but-not-great\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Verdict: Good, But Not Great</a></h3><p>Look, this isn’t a <em>bad</em> bass. It’s a <strong>decent entry point</strong> if you want to get close to the Stingray aesthetic and layout without the cost. But for me, it didn’t quite deliver where it mattered. Between the underwhelming tone, the slightly off colour, and the tuner issues, I just couldn’t justify keeping it.</p><p>Especially when you consider that my <strong><a href=\"/blog/harley-benton-mb-4-sbk/\">Harley Benton MB-4 SBK</a></strong>, which costs <strong>about a third of the price</strong>, feels about the same level of build quality and sounds better to my ears.</p><hr><h3 id=\"the-bottom-line\"><a href=\"#the-bottom-line\" class=\"heading-anchor\">The Bottom Line</a></h3><p>✅ <strong>Pros</strong>:</p><ul><li>Classic Stingray shape and layout</li><li>Comfortable neck with a slim nut width</li><li>Active EQ offers tonal options</li><li>That 3+1 headstock still looks cool</li></ul><p>❌ <strong>Cons</strong>:</p><ul><li>Flat, uninspiring tone</li><li>Colour looked different in person</li><li>Tuner reliability was questionable</li><li>Doesn’t feel like good value compared to <a href=\"/blog/harley-benton-mb-4-sbk/\">other options</a></li></ul><p>If you’re desperate for a Stingray and you’re on a tight budget, the S.U.B. Ray4 might scratch the itch—just don’t expect fireworks. Personally, I think there are better-value alternatives out there.</p><p><strong>Final verdict? Close, but no cigar.</strong></p>",

Enter the <strong>Harley Benton MB-4 SBK</strong>—a budget-friendly beast that surprised me in all the best ways.</p><h3 id=\"first-impressions\"><a href=\"#first-impressions\" class=\"heading-anchor\">First Impressions</a></h3><p>Out of the box, the MB-4 SBK oozes attitude. Its <strong>matte black finish</strong>, black hardware, and matching headstock give it a stealthy, modern look. It feels solid, tipping the scales at around <strong>4 kg</strong>, with a full <strong>34-inch scale</strong> and a <strong>bolt-on maple neck</strong> topped with a <strong>roseacer fretboard</strong>. The neck has a comfy D-profile and a nice low action, making it easy to zip around the <strong>21 frets</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"the-sound\"><a href=\"#the-sound\" class=\"heading-anchor\">The Sound</a></h3><p>Let’s cut to the chase: <strong>it sounds fantastic</strong>—especially for the price. The <strong>Humbucker pickup</strong> with passive electronics delivers that scooped sound you would expect from a Stingray-style bass. It does have versatility with the tone control you can get some mellow sounds, but it really shines when you crank the treble.</p><p>But be warned—the output is <strong>hot</strong>. Like, really hot. So hot, in fact, that it overloads my Digitech Drop pedal. If you’re running into pedals or an interface, you might want to check your gain staging.</p><h3 id=\"playability-and-build\"><a href=\"#playability-and-build\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Playability &amp; Build</a></h3><p>This thing plays beautifully. The <strong>fretwork is clean</strong>, the <strong>finish is flawless</strong>, and the <strong>build quality feels far above what you’d expect at this price</strong>. The body is made from poplar, which is lightweight but still gives a nice, balanced tone. The <strong>die-cast bridge</strong> is solid and keeps things nicely anchored.</p><h3 id=\"the-downsides\"><a href=\"#the-downsides\" class=\"heading-anchor\">The Downsides</a></h3><p>It’s not perfect, of course. A few small issues stood out:</p><ul><li>The <strong>volume knobs rubbed against the control plate</strong> slightly and needed to be lifted a bit to stop catching.</li><li>The <strong>tuners feel cheap</strong>, and there’s a little play when you turn them—but they <strong>do hold tuning well</strong>, so it’s more of a feel thing than a functional problem.</li><li>I’m not in love with the <strong>two volume knob setup</strong>. I’d personally prefer a single volume control and a standard tone knob, rather than juggling two knobs to blend the coils.</li><li>The matte finish will show fingerprints and smudges, and over time will lose its sheen.</li></ul><h3 id=\"final-thoughts\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Final Thoughts</a></h3><p>All things considered, the Harley Benton MB-4 SBK punches way above its weight. For the price, you’re getting:</p><p>✅ Excellent <strong>sound</strong><br>✅ Impressive <strong>build quality</strong><br>✅ Stealth <strong>aesthetics</strong><br>✅ Comfortable <strong>playability</strong><br>✅ Remarkable <strong>value for money</strong><br>✅ <strong>Passive</strong> electronics (no batteries needed!)</p><p>If you’re okay with a couple of minor quirks—and maybe swapping out the tuners down the line—you’ll find a lot to love here. Whether you’re just starting out or need a solid backup bass, the MB-4 SBK is a serious contender.</p><p><strong>Would I buy it again? Absolutely.</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://harleybenton.com/product/mb-4-sbk/\" rel=\"noopener\">Harley Benton MB-4 SBK product page</a></p><h3 id=\"back-to-black\"><a href=\"#back-to-black\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Back to Black</a></h3><p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/blog/harley-benton-mb-4-sbk/sueg1yxUWh-650.webp 650w, /blog/harley-benton-mb-4-sbk/sueg1yxUWh-960.webp 960w, /blog/harley-benton-mb-4-sbk/sueg1yxUWh-1400.webp 1400w\" sizes=\"auto\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/blog/harley-benton-mb-4-sbk/sueg1yxUWh-650.jpeg\" alt=\"Harley Benton MB-4 SBK with black pick guard\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"/blog/harley-benton-mb-4-sbk/sueg1yxUWh-650.jpeg 650w, /blog/harley-benton-mb-4-sbk/sueg1yxUWh-960.jpeg 960w, /blog/harley-benton-mb-4-sbk/sueg1yxUWh-1400.jpeg 1400w\" sizes=\"auto\"></picture></p><p>One thing that bothered me was the tort pickguard.
