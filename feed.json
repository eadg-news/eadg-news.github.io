At just <strong>£17.99</strong>, it promises impressive specs for the price — including a detachable silver-plated cable, a 10mm magnetic driver, and multiple eartip options.</p><p>We were intrigued. Unfortunately, when it comes to bass — the one thing that really matters for this site — the KBEAR Storm fails hard.</p><hr><h3 id=\"pros\"><a href=\"#pros\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Pros</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Good Build Quality</strong>: The plastic housings feel well-made and solid, especially at this price point.</li><li><strong>Comfortable Fit</strong>: Lightweight and ergonomically shaped; they stay put during long sessions without fatigue.</li><li><strong>Attractive Design</strong>: Available in several colours with a sleek, modern look.</li><li><strong>Decent Accessories</strong>: Comes with multiple eartips (6 pairs in 3 sizes), which helps with fit and isolation.</li><li><strong>Quiet Cable</strong>: The over-ear cable doesn’t transmit rubbing noise, and it’s removable, allowing for upgrades.</li></ul><hr><h3 id=\"cons\"><a href=\"#cons\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Cons</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Lack of Bass Response</strong>: The biggest issue. The low end is <strong>practically absent</strong>, and even EQ boosting doesn’t help much.</li><li><strong>Tinny Sound</strong>: Without low-end support, the overall sound signature leans heavily toward thin and brittle.</li></ul><hr><h3 id=\"the-bass-test\"><a href=\"#the-bass-test\" class=\"heading-anchor\">The Bass Test</a></h3><p>As a <strong>bass-centric review site</strong>, we’re always evaluating IEMs by how well they handle low frequencies — both for <strong>listening</strong> and <strong>monitoring live bass</strong>. The KBEAR Storm, despite manufacturer claims of “powerful and affecting bass,” simply does <strong>not deliver</strong>.</p><p>No matter the source — phone, DAC/amp, or EQ tweaks — the low end remained thin and lifeless. Boosting 60–100 Hz did very little. Even 500 Hz boosts to recover warmth didn’t add punch. For bass players or fans of bass-heavy music, this makes the KBEAR Storm <strong>unusable</strong>.</p><hr><h3 id=\"verdict\"><a href=\"#verdict\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Verdict</a></h3><p>If you’re on a <strong>tight budget</strong>, mainly listening to podcasts, or using a Samsung phone with Dolby Atmos and you <strong>don’t care about bass</strong>, the KBEAR Storm might be a comfortable and affordable entry-level IEM.</p><p>But if you’re a <strong>bass player</strong>, a <strong>music producer</strong>, or just a <strong>fan of heavy low-end</strong>, <strong>these are not for you</strong>.</p><hr><h3 id=\"final-rating\"><a href=\"#final-rating\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Final Rating</a></h3><p>🎧 <strong>Comfort &amp; Fit</strong>: ★★★★☆</p><p>🎨 <strong>Build &amp; Aesthetics</strong>: ★★★★☆</p><p>💰 <strong>Value for Money</strong>: ★★★☆☆</p><p>🎵 <strong>Sound (General)</strong>: ★★☆☆☆</p><p>🎸 <strong>Bass Performance</strong>: ☆☆☆☆☆ <em>(unusable for bass monitoring)</em></p>",

Ray4 Review – The Budget Stingray That Missed the Mark</strong></p><p>Let’s get one thing out of the way: I’ve <strong>always wanted a Stingray</strong>. That big, bold Music Man tone, the iconic look, and that unmistakable 3+1 headstock have been calling my name for years. So when I spotted the <strong>Sterling by Music Man S.U.B. Ray4</strong>, I figured this might finally scratch the itch—without emptying the wallet.</p><p><strong>S.U.B.</strong>, in case you didn’t know, stands for <strong>“Sports Utility Bass”</strong>—and this Indonesian-made model is the most affordable entry into the Stingray world. It’s got the vibe, the looks (mostly), and the layout. But unfortunately, it didn’t quite deliver in the ways that matter most.</p><hr><h3 id=\"first-impressions\"><a href=\"#first-impressions\" class=\"heading-anchor\">First Impressions</a></h3><p>Out of the box, the <strong>Vintage Cream finish</strong> was… not quite what I expected. Online it looked classy and understated, but in person it leaned a bit more <strong>pink</strong>—kind of a <strong>“skin tone”</strong> shade that didn’t feel as bold or confident as I hoped. That’s purely subjective, of course, but it did leave me a little underwhelmed at first glance.</p><p>That said, it still has the <strong>classic Stingray shape</strong>, the <strong>3+1 headstock</strong>, and a nice slim <strong>38mm nut width</strong> that makes it comfortable in the hand.</p><hr><h3 id=\"build-and-hardware\"><a href=\"#build-and-hardware\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Build &amp; Hardware</a></h3><p>Now, this is where things started to wobble—literally. While tuning up for the first time, <strong>two of the tuners slipped</strong> as I tightened them. That’s not something you want to experience on a brand-new bass, no matter the price.</p><p>The body is made of <strong>basswood</strong>, paired with a <strong>maple neck</strong> and a <strong>jatoba fretboard</strong>. It’s a familiar recipe for budget instruments, and overall the construction is okay. Nothing alarming—aside from the tuners—but nothing exceptional either.</p><hr><h3 id=\"tone-and-electronics\"><a href=\"#tone-and-electronics\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Tone &amp; Electronics</a></h3><p>The S.U.B. Ray4 comes equipped with a single <strong>H-1 ceramic humbucker</strong> and <strong>active 2-band EQ</strong>. On paper, that should give you plenty of tonal flexibility and the aggressive Stingray bite we all know and love.</p><p>In practice? It just felt a little <strong>flat</strong>. The tone lacked <strong>dynamics</strong>, and even with some EQ tweaking, I couldn’t quite dial in the kind of presence I was after. The <strong>active electronics</strong> gave it volume and brightness, but not much character. It felt like the essence of the Stingray was only half there—like a photocopy of a painting.</p><hr><h3 id=\"verdict-good-but-not-great\"><a href=\"#verdict-good-but-not-great\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Verdict: Good, But Not Great</a></h3><p>Look, this isn’t a <em>bad</em> bass. It’s a <strong>decent entry point</strong> if you want to get close to the Stingray aesthetic and layout without the cost. But for me, it didn’t quite deliver where it mattered. Between the underwhelming tone, the slightly off colour, and the tuner issues, I just couldn’t justify keeping it.</p><p>Especially when you consider that my <strong><a href=\"/blog/harley-benton-mb-4-sbk/\">Harley Benton MB-4 SBK</a></strong>, which costs <strong>about a third of the price</strong>, feels about the same level of build quality and sounds better to my ears.</p><hr><h3 id=\"the-bottom-line\"><a href=\"#the-bottom-line\" class=\"heading-anchor\">The Bottom Line</a></h3><p>✅ <strong>Pros</strong>:</p><ul><li>Classic Stingray shape and layout</li><li>Comfortable neck with a slim nut width</li><li>Active EQ offers tonal options</li><li>That 3+1 headstock still looks cool</li></ul><p>❌ <strong>Cons</strong>:</p><ul><li>Flat, uninspiring tone</li><li>Colour looked different in person</li><li>Tuner reliability was questionable</li><li>Doesn’t feel like good value compared to <a href=\"/blog/harley-benton-mb-4-sbk/\">other options</a></li></ul><p>If you’re desperate for a Stingray and you’re on a tight budget, the S.U.B. Ray4 might scratch the itch—just don’t expect fireworks. Personally, I think there are better-value alternatives out there.</p><p><strong>Final verdict? Close, but no cigar.</strong></p>",

Enter the <strong>Harley Benton MB-4 SBK</strong>—a budget-friendly beast that surprised me in all the best ways.</p><h3 id=\"first-impressions\"><a href=\"#first-impressions\" class=\"heading-anchor\">First Impressions</a></h3><p>Out of the box, the MB-4 SBK oozes attitude. Its <strong>matte black finish</strong>, black hardware, and matching headstock give it a stealthy, modern look. It feels solid, tipping the scales at around <strong>4 kg</strong>, with a full <strong>34-inch scale</strong> and a <strong>bolt-on maple neck</strong> topped with a <strong>roseacer fretboard</strong>. The neck has a comfy D-profile and a nice low action, making it easy to zip around the <strong>21 frets</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"the-sound\"><a href=\"#the-sound\" class=\"heading-anchor\">The Sound</a></h3><p>Let’s cut to the chase: <strong>it sounds fantastic</strong>—especially for the price. The <strong>Humbucker pickup</strong> with passive electronics delivers that scooped sound you would expect from a Stingray-style bass. It does have versatility with the tone control you can get some mellow sounds, but it really shines when you crank the treble.</p><p>But be warned—the output is <strong>hot</strong>. Like, really hot. So hot, in fact, that it overloads my Digitech Drop pedal. If you’re running into pedals or an interface, you might want to check your gain staging.</p><h3 id=\"playability-and-build\"><a href=\"#playability-and-build\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Playability &amp; Build</a></h3><p>This thing plays beautifully. The <strong>fretwork is clean</strong>, the <strong>finish is flawless</strong>, and the <strong>build quality feels far above what you’d expect at this price</strong>. The body is made from poplar, which is lightweight but still gives a nice, balanced tone. The <strong>die-cast bridge</strong> is solid and keeps things nicely anchored.</p><h3 id=\"the-downsides\"><a href=\"#the-downsides\" class=\"heading-anchor\">The Downsides</a></h3><p>It’s not perfect, of course. A few small issues stood out:</p><ul><li>The <strong>volume knobs rubbed against the control plate</strong> slightly and needed to be lifted a bit to stop catching.</li><li>The <strong>tuners feel cheap</strong>, and there’s a little play when you turn them—but they <strong>do hold tuning well</strong>, so it’s more of a feel thing than a functional problem.</li><li>I’m not in love with the <strong>two volume knob setup</strong>. I’d personally prefer a single volume control and a standard tone knob, rather than juggling two knobs to blend the coils.</li><li>The matte finish will show fingerprints and smudges, and over time will lose its sheen.</li></ul><h3 id=\"final-thoughts\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Final Thoughts</a></h3><p>All things considered, the Harley Benton MB-4 SBK punches way above its weight. For the price, you’re getting:</p><p>✅ Excellent <strong>sound</strong><br>✅ Impressive <strong>build quality</strong><br>✅ Stealth <strong>aesthetics</strong><br>✅ Comfortable <strong>playability</strong><br>✅ Remarkable <strong>value for money</strong><br>✅ <strong>Passive</strong> electronics (no batteries needed!)</p><p>If you’re okay with a couple of minor quirks—and maybe swapping out the tuners down the line—you’ll find a lot to love here. Whether you’re just starting out or need a solid backup bass, the MB-4 SBK is a serious contender.</p><p><strong>Would I buy it again? Absolutely.</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://harleybenton.com/product/mb-4-sbk/\" rel=\"noopener\">Harley Benton MB-4 SBK product page</a></p><h3 id=\"back-to-black\"><a href=\"#back-to-black\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Back to Black</a></h3><p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/blog/harley-benton-mb-4-sbk/sueg1yxUWh-650.webp 650w, /blog/harley-benton-mb-4-sbk/sueg1yxUWh-960.webp 960w, /blog/harley-benton-mb-4-sbk/sueg1yxUWh-1400.webp 1400w\" sizes=\"auto\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"/blog/harley-benton-mb-4-sbk/sueg1yxUWh-650.jpeg\" alt=\"Harley Benton MB-4 SBK with black pick guard\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"/blog/harley-benton-mb-4-sbk/sueg1yxUWh-650.jpeg 650w, /blog/harley-benton-mb-4-sbk/sueg1yxUWh-960.jpeg 960w, /blog/harley-benton-mb-4-sbk/sueg1yxUWh-1400.jpeg 1400w\" sizes=\"auto\"></picture></p><p>One thing that bothered me was the tort pickguard. It just didn’t match the sleek black aesthetic of the rest of the instrument.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://amzn.eu/d/clZIQRN\" rel=\"noopener\">Musically pickguard</a> on Amazon fitted with a small amount of trimming at the neck pocket, and it’s 9 holes didn’t quite line up with the original 7, but it works well enough.</p><p>BTW - You can see the fingerprints and dust that the matte finish picks up :¬)</p>",
