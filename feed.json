Enter the <strong>Harley Benton MB-4 SBK</strong>—a budget-friendly beast that surprised me in all the best ways.</p><h3 id=\"first-impressions\"><a href=\"#first-impressions\" class=\"heading-anchor\">First Impressions</a></h3><p>Out of the box, the MB-4 SBK oozes attitude. Its <strong>matte black finish</strong>, black hardware, and matching headstock give it a stealthy, modern look. It feels solid, tipping the scales at around <strong>4 kg</strong>, with a full <strong>34-inch scale</strong> and a <strong>bolt-on maple neck</strong> topped with a <strong>roseacer fretboard</strong>. The neck has a comfy D-profile and a nice low action, making it easy to zip around the <strong>21 frets</strong>.</p><h3 id=\"the-sound\"><a href=\"#the-sound\" class=\"heading-anchor\">The Sound</a></h3><p>Let’s cut to the chase: <strong>it sounds fantastic</strong>—especially for the price. The <strong>Humbucker pickup</strong> with passive electronics delivers that scooped sound you would expect from a Stingray-style bass. It does have versatility with the tone control you can get some mellow sounds, but it really shines when you crank the treble.</p><p>But be warned—the output is <strong>hot</strong>. Like, really hot. So hot, in fact, that it overloads my Digitech Drop pedal. If you’re running into pedals or an interface, you might want to check your gain staging.</p><h3 id=\"playability-and-build\"><a href=\"#playability-and-build\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Playability &amp; Build</a></h3><p>This thing plays beautifully. The <strong>fretwork is clean</strong>, the <strong>finish is flawless</strong>, and the <strong>build quality feels far above what you’d expect at this price</strong>. The body is made from poplar, which is lightweight but still gives a nice, balanced tone. The <strong>die-cast bridge</strong> is solid and keeps things nicely anchored.</p><h3 id=\"the-downsides\"><a href=\"#the-downsides\" class=\"heading-anchor\">The Downsides</a></h3><p>It’s not perfect, of course. A few small issues stood out:</p><ul><li>The <strong>volume knobs rubbed against the control plate</strong> slightly and needed to be lifted a bit to stop catching.</li><li>The <strong>tuners feel cheap</strong>, and there’s a little play when you turn them—but they <strong>do hold tuning well</strong>, so it’s more of a feel thing than a functional problem.</li><li>I’m not in love with the <strong>two volume knob setup</strong>. I’d personally prefer a single volume control and a standard tone knob, rather than juggling two knobs to blend the coils.</li><li>The matte finish will show fingerprints and smudges, and over time will lose its sheen.</li></ul><h3 id=\"final-thoughts\"><a href=\"#final-thoughts\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Final Thoughts</a></h3><p>All things considered, the Harley Benton MB-4 SBK punches way above its weight. For the price, you’re getting:</p><p>✅ Excellent <strong>sound</strong><br>✅ Impressive <strong>build quality</strong><br>✅ Stealth <strong>aesthetics</strong><br>✅ Comfortable <strong>playability</strong><br>✅ Remarkable <strong>value for money</strong><br>✅ <strong>Passive</strong> electronics (no batteries needed!)</p><p>If you’re okay with a couple of minor quirks—and maybe swapping out the tuners down the line—you’ll find a lot to love here. Whether you’re just starting out or need a solid backup bass, the MB-4 SBK is a serious contender.</p><p><strong>Would I buy it again? Absolutely.</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://harleybenton.com/product/mb-4-sbk/\" rel=\"noopener\">Harley Benton MB-4 SBK product page</a></p>",
